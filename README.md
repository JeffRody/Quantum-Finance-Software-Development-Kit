# Quantum-Finance-Software-Development-Kit
Financial investors and quantitative analysts are facing great challenges since the vigorous development of internet finance and 24-hour program trading platforms around the world. Financial markets are more high-frequency volatility and unpredictable than before, especially global financial markets, foreign exchange markets, and commodity markets. In the past decades, various quantitative trading strategies, quantum finance theories, and artificial intelligence technologies are introduced for more stable returns. Fintech and intelligent finance also have become one of the hottest topics in worldwide financial institutions. Recently, many online trading platforms are developing intelligent financial trading kits for their platform customers. To our knowledge, these kits only integrate some financial information and trading functions API, but lack quantum finance and AI tools, which are not suitable for intelligent quantum finance education. In this paper, a quantum finance software development kit was performed. The kit consists of quantum finance tool, deep learning tool, chaotic neural network tool, and support vector machine tool, which can be applied to any online financial trading platform based on python programming language. The kit also makes it easier for intelligent quantum finance students and researchers to implement an intelligent quantum financial forecast and trading system in their projects.
